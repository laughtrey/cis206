# CIS 206 - Programming in Java - Java for Everyone by Cay Horstmann

## Projects

### 2 SumProductAverage - Feb 18
>Working with the basics, arithmetic with Java.

### 3 Decisions - Feb 25
>If statement. If something is true, if something is !true, etc.

### 4 Loops - March 4
>Looping. Moving through things and do,while,else if,for.

### 5 Methods - March 10
>Methods are functions from C++! Going to make my first one that scrambles up words.

### 6 Arrays - March 25
>Made an array of theater seats. I wanted to fill the prices with for loops automatically, but in hindsight it
>makes more sense to do small arrays like that manually, you want to be able to easily change each value by hand.

### -- Midterm - April 1
>Similar to the C++ midterm, made a list of names and returns the position. I used a Vector because I know C++
>but Java has ArrayList, which is basically the same thing.

### 8 Objects and Classes - April 15
>My first multi-file compilation in Java and my first individual class and object.
>Java is nice without the headers, but I wonder what the advantages of C++ are over Java at this point.

### 7 Input and Output - April 22
>Input and output, working with files. The Scanner object is really smart and I like
>using it so far. The split() function is really convenient too, I don't know if C++ has it.

### 9 Inheritance and Interfaces - May 6 
>I'm familiar with this from C++, but I sort of like the way Java does it a little bit better.
>Maybe it's because I'm finding Java a bit more consistent overall, but it's a lot easier to keep track
>of things for some reason.
