# Project - Word Scramble
### Complete project 5.3 in the text

>It is a well-known phenomenon that most people are easily able to read a text whose words have two characters flipped, provided the first and last letter of each word are not changed. For example:


```
I dnâ€™ot gvie a dman for a man taht can olny sepll a wrod one way. (Mark Twain)
```

>Write a method String scramble(String word) that constructs a scrambled version of a given word, randomly flipping two characters other than the first and last one. Then write a program that reads words and prints the scrambled words.  The following pseudocode may help you to develop the method,


 *Check if word length of string is greater than 3
 If word length is greater than 3
 Then
 Generate 2 indexes of the characters to swap
 Swap the characters in the string
 End If
 Return the string*
