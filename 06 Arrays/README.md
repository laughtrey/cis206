# Arrays - Theater seats
* A theater seating chart is implemented as a two-dimension array o ticket prices, like this:

```Java
10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
10 10 20 20 20 20 20 20 10 10
10 10 20 20 20 20 20 20 10 10
10 10 20 20 20 20 20 20 10 10
20 20 30 30 40 40 30 30 20 20
20 30 30 40 50 50 40 30 30 20
30 40 50 50 50 50 50 50 40 30
```

* Write a program that prompts users to pick either a seat or a price. Mark sold seats by changing the price to 0. When a
user specifies a seat, make sure it is available. When a user specifices a price, find any seat with that price.
